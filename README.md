# ArgosThesis

Repository created to keep track of my master thesis during the period of june 2019 - january 2020.

## Installation
In order to run the experiment, you first need to install ARGoS on your computer or VM. Follow the installation guide on [Github](https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3 "ARGoS"). Before you continue, make sure to copy the two files from [the space_diff folder](https://github.com/timothythiecke/ArgosThesis/tree/master/space_diff) to your ARGoS installation folder `argos3\src\core\simulator\space` and make ARGoS again (these are required for the ring distributor of the experiment)
